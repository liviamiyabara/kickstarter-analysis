# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
In the spreadsheet we have the data of Louiseâ€™s fundraising campaigns and we will make an analysis to understand know how different the Theater campaigns performed in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

In May and June is when a larger amount of theater campaigns is launched and successful. The number of campaigns decreases as we reach the end of the year, in November and December, we have a lower amount of campaigns released and during December we have the lowest successful rate. By looking at the chart we could assume that the best months to announce a new theater campaign is in May and June.  
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
